# Loan Predictor Flask Application

This is a Data Science project that predicts the status of incoming loan using categorical data (Gender, Marriage Status, and ect.) and numerical data 
(Income, Loan Term Amount, etc.). The best model will be imported into Flask and then uploaded to a local website in order to run an interactive process.
Dataset comes from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/leonbora/analytics-vidhya-loan-prediction).

## Getting Started

Download files from the the repository. It dataset is already in a sub-folder called "Data" in the repository. 

### Prerequisites

- Flask
- Python
- Numpy
- Seaborn 
- matplotlib

```
Go to conda, gitbash, or any command line interface and import these specific libraries.
```

## Deployment

Inside of files is a app.py file, you will need to run this file with your virtual enviroment in order to deploy the predictor in a local default browser.
